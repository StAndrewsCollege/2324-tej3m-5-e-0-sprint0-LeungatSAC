# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal

For your roboCup sprints you will be setting your own goals that can be completed within a given time (usually two weeks). For our first sprint your goal will be given to you and will be completed in one week.

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

You will submit the instructions and diagrams that would allow another to make your designed tower, 

## Process and Goals

Goals: Research functional towers
Find a proper base
Find proper method of creating links
Stands for at least 30 seconds
Look at other attempts at this challenge and improve building

### Research

Takeaways: Makes a base, then stack the paper while keeping as wide as possible
